**CoReS: Orchestrating the Dance of Reasoning and Segmentation**  _(**ECCV2024**)_ [Homepage](https://chain-of-reasoning-and-segmentation.github.io/) <br>
  - In the face of complex reasoning contexts, multimodal large language models (MLLM) often find it difficult to accurately identify and locate the objects they describe.
  - Inspired by the cognitive stages of human visual search, where each step is a gradual refinement of thinking towards the ultimate goal, the bimodal thought chain CoReS is proposed, which proves that the top-down visual hierarchy enhances the visual search process.
  - A double-chain structure is proposed to generate multimodal chained outputs. To guide the output of MLLM to reach the expected hierarchical structure, an additional in-context input paradigm is proposed.
  - Experiments on tasks such as reasoning segmentation prove the excellent performance of CoReS, which is 6.5% higher than the state-of-the-art method on the ReasonSeg dataset.

**Relevant Intrinsic Feature Enhancement Network for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation**  _(**AAAI2024**)_ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06474)  [Code](https://github.com/baoxiaoyi/RiFeNet)<br>
  - The key to the few-shot semantic segmentation task is to extract class-related information from limited support data. However, due to insufficient training data, traditional methods are prone to overfitting problems, and the intra-class differences of new categories also hinder the model's adaptability and generalization.
  - The relevant feature enhancement network (ReFENet) is proposed. An additional unlabeled branch is integrated into the mainstream two-branch framework to alleviate overfitting by enriching relevant features.
  - A multi-level prototype generation and interaction module is proposed. Global and local prototypes are extracted from different branches, and complementary information of different granularities is realized through prototype interaction to enhance the model's representational ability.
  - The performance of ReFENet exceeds the state-of-the-art method by 2.6% on the PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets.
